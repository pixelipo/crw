# Webshop on React + Redux + Firebase

## About

This is a simple, but fully-functional React webshop.

- It uses [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) with [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect).
- Data storage and user authentication is handled via [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs) is integrated as a simple checkout/payments solution.
- Whole app is wrapped with my [React Docker Boilerplate](https://github.com/pixelipo/react-boilerplate) for easy local development
